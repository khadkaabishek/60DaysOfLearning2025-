🌟 Day 59 of Learning 🌟
Today, I focused on debugging and resolving a few issues that surfaced 
after recent changes in my codebase. It was a productive session of r-
efining and polishing key components. 🛠️🧠✨

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Fixed a re-rendering issue caused by the Draggable Price Filter — r-
   esolved it by wrapping the `onPriceChange` function in a `useCallback` 
   hook to prevent infinite loops.
2. Resolved a mismatch between `_id` and `id` in the Google login flow —
   I was expecting `id`, but MongoDB returns `_id`. Also updated the user 
   schema to include a new attribute, and handled it cleanly in the back-
   end logic.
3. Fixed a UI issue where longer-named products in the bill were overflo-
   wing or floating out of layout bounds — applied proper styling to keep 
   things tidy.

✅ Summary:

✔️ Prevented infinite re-renders in the price filter with a proper useCall
   back setup.
✔️ Aligned Google OAuth response handling with the correct MongoDB `_id` 
   field.
✔️ Improved product bill layout to support long names gracefully.

Much excited to host this project live soon! ^_^ 🎉
