🌟 Day 40 of Learning 🌟
Today, I focused on building a charming and user-friendly Seller Onboarding UI — allowing normal 
users to seamlessly apply to become official sellers on the platform. 🛍️💼✨

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Created a complete React-based Seller Onboarding page inspired by Daraz's UX principles.
2. Built modular components including:

   * A dynamic hero section with a call-to-action to scroll to the form
   * Informational sections explaining why users should sell on our platform
   * A clean and responsive application form for seller registration
   * FAQ section for resolving common doubts
3. Implemented a preview feature that shows sample NID document format before upload.
4. Allowed users to upload official documents (NID front/back, address proof) via a form with `multipart/form-data`.

✅ Summary:
✔️ Structured a modern and clear seller application flow
✔️ Enabled file uploads to verify real users during application
✔️ Integrated a smooth scroll-to-form experience from the CTA button
✔️ Added FAQ and benefit highlights for better transparency and trust

The seller UI is now beautifully functional and intuitive — and I'm excited to start building the 
backend logic to process and store seller applications securely! 🚀🛠️
