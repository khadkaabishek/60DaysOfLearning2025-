🌟 Day 106 of Learning 🌟
Today, I explored Nodemailer, a popular Node.js library used for sending emails via SMTP. It was an exciting session integrating this feature into my user signup flow, bringing the backend and frontend together seamlessly. 📬⚙️💻

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Learned how Nodemailer works — including transporter setup and sending test emails via SMTP.
2. Integrated Nodemailer in the signup flow, sending a confirmation email upon successful registration.
3. Made changes to the User model to accommodate email-related data handling.
4. Updated the **UI for signup** to reflect the new email notification system.

✅ Summary:

✔️ Successfully sent transactional emails using Nodemailer.
✔️ Refactored the user model to better support email communication.
✔️ Improved the signup UI for a more polished user experience.

Even though its day 60, last date of leapfrog but not mine 
Next up: Forget Password Section — can't wait to build and test it! 🔐
Much excited to see the authentication system coming to life! 🚀
