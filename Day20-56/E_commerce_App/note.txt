Today, I categorized products based on their types and implemented a draggable price filter section — creating a more intuitive and user-friendly browsing experience. 🛍️🧲💸

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Grouped products dynamically by category to simplify navigation and browsing.
2. Built a draggable price range filte to let users control the min-max range with ease.
3. Integrated category filtering and price filtering seamlessly for better UX flow.

✅ Summary:

✔️ Enhanced the product discovery process with category-based organization.
✔️ Designed a sleek, interactive price filter UI that’s both functional and engaging.
✔️ Improved user experience by combining multiple filters for a smoother shopping journey.
