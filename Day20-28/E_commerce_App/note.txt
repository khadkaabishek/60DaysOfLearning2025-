🌟 Day 28 of Learning 🌟  
Today, I implemented role-based access control and key authentication middlewares to
 enhance the security and functionality of my backend system 🚀

🎯 What I worked on:  
1. Built a middleware to check if a logged-in user has a valid JWT token during login.  
2. Created a `restrictTo` function to differentiate between admin and normal users.  
3. Allowed admin users to access special features by validating their roles.  
4. Performed testing to verify authentication and authorization flows.

✅ Summary:

✔️ Developed secure login validation logic using JWT  
✔️ Implemented role-based access control for admin privileges  
✔️ Successfully tested protected routes to ensure correct behavior  

Feeling great as access control and user management become more robust! 🔐⚙️
