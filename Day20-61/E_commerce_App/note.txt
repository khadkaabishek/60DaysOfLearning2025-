🌟 Day 61 of Learning 🌟
Today was all about forgetting passwords — without worry! 🔐💡 I finally implemented the "Forgot Password" functionality, completing one of the most important parts of the user authentication system. From UI tweaks to stubborn API bugs, today was a battle I won with code and coffee! ☕👨‍💻

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Implemented the "Forgot Password" flow with OTP verification and password reset.
2. Updated the Login UI to support conditional rendering for Forgot Password mode.
3. Faced and fixed some relentless API issues that didn’t want to cooperate at first — but persistence paid off!
4. Reused logic smartly while also writing new service functions for clean separation of concerns.

✅ Summary:

✔️ Users can now request an OTP and reset their password safely.
✔️ UI looks cleaner and more dynamic with conditional states for Login/Forgot modes.
✔️ Backend APIs now behave as expected after tough debugging sessions.
✔️ A bit of repetition in code — but everything works, and it's modular now.

Even though the Leapfrog deadline passed, my learning hasn’t — I'm still going strong!
Next up: Better error handling and final polish on the full auth flow! 🚀
