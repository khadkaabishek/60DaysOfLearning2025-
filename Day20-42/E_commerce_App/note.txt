🌟 Day 42 of Learning* 🌟
Today, I focused on building the backend logic to securely handle and process seller 
application data.This completes the other half of the seller onboarding system, making 
it production-ready and robust! ⚙️🔐🚀

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Integrated `multer` middleware to handle and store image uploads (NID front, NID back,
 address proof) using `multipart/form-data`.
2. Sent form data from the frontend using `fetch()` and successfully received and processed
 it on the backend.
3. Validated and saved the submitted seller information (email, phone, address, documents)
 into the MongoDB schema.
4. Used Postman to test and manage API endpoints for various use cases — ensuring smooth 
communication between client and server.

✅ Summary:
✔️ Built a secure and efficient route for seller onboarding using Express + Multer
✔️ Verified that file uploads and form data are correctly handled and stored
✔️ Connected frontend and backend seamlessly with dynamic fetch requests
✔️ Ensured everything works reliably through API testing in Postman

I'm thrilled to see the full seller onboarding flow now working end-to-end — from the React
UI to the database! Next, I’ll explore building admin review functionality and status updates. 💡📈🧠
