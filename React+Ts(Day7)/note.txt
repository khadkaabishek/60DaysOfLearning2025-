🌟 Day 7 of Learning 🌟
Today, I explored React with TypeScript — a powerful combination for building robust, production-ready web applications.

---

🎯 What I learned today:

1. Set up a React + TypeScript project

   I initialized a new React project with TypeScript support and understood the setup process from scratch.
   command : npx create-react-app react_typescript —template typescript

2. Understood the project structure

  I took time to explore how the folder and file layout works in a TypeScript-powered React project, learning how each part connects.

3. Learned about components in React

  I studied the core idea of components — how they encapsulate logic and UI, and how they're used to build scalable interfaces.

4. Used props to pass data between component

  I learned how to pass variables from one component to another using props, a fundamental concept in building dynamic UIs.

5.  Discovered the power of destructuring
 I practiced destructuring objects in props for cleaner and more readable code, which also helps with maintaining type safety.

✔ Successfully set up a React project with TypeScript
✔ Gained clarity on how React components work and communicate
✔ Explored how TypeScript improves code quality and structure
✔ Practiced destructuring for cleaner and more expressive syntax
✔ Each step revealed how React and TypeScript complement each other
