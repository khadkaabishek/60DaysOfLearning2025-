🌟 Day 20 of Learning 🌟
Today, I focused on **project setup for a Node.js + TypeScript backend with MongoDB** —
laying the foundation with clean folder structure, tooling, and initial server connection.

🎯 What I accomplished today:

📦 Node + TypeScript Initialization
Initialized a new Node.js project and set it up with TypeScript for better type safety and maintainability.

🔧 Linting and Formatting
Installed and configured ESLint and Prettier to enforce code style and auto-formatting.

📁 Folder Structure (MVC)
Created a clean folder structure:
`controllers/`, `routes/`, `middlewares/`, `models/`, and `utils/` for maintainable architecture.

🚀 Express Server Setup
Built a basic Express server with a health-check route.

🌱 MongoDB Integration
Connected to MongoDB using Mongoose and handled success/error logging.

🧠 User Schema
Defined a basic User schema with fields: `name`, `email`, `password`, `role` (default: `'user'`), and `createdAt`.

📌 Summary:
✔ Initialized backend with Node + TypeScript
✔ Setup ESLint, Prettier, and tsconfig for clean code
✔ Created MVC-based folder structure
✔ Connected Express server with MongoDB using Mongoose
✔ Created a basic User schema to kick off authentication system
