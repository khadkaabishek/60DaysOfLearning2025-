🌟 Day 29 of Learning 🌟
Today, I implemented search, filtering, and pagination features in the product API to improve
 product discoverability in my e-commerce backend 🚀

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Added keyword-based search using MongoDB's `$regex` on name and description fields.
2. Implemented filters for category and price range using query parameters.
3. Integrated pagination with `page` and `limit` parameters to return specific batches of products.
4. Converted the controller to CommonJS syntax to fix import/export module issues.

✅ Summary:

✔️ Enabled dynamic product search with case-insensitive keyword matching
✔️ Filtered product results by category and price range
✔️ Implemented backend pagination for better scalability
✔️ Resolved module compatibility issues by standardizing to CommonJS

Feeling accomplished as the product API now supports real-world browsing features! 🛍🔍📦
