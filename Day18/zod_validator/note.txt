🌟 Day 18 of Learning 🌟
Today, I explored using Zod as an Express validator and how to set up TypeScript correctly 
in a backend project. From handling syntax issues in .js to switching over to proper .ts 
with ts-node, it was a practical dive into type-safe validation.

🎯 What I learned today:
1️⃣ Difference between JS and TS syntax — like why : z.ZodSchema<any> broke .js files.
2️⃣ Installed and configured typescript, ts-node, @types/node, and @types/express for proper TS support.
3️⃣ Learned how to create a reusable validate() middleware using Zod.
4️⃣ Successfully built a typed Express API endpoint with clean schema validation.
5️⃣ Understood how Zod + TypeScript boosts code safety and improves error handling.

📌 Summary:
✔ Zod simplifies validation without extra boilerplate
✔ TypeScript helped me catch and fix issues before runtime
✔ Learned how to run .ts files using ts-node
✔ Cleaner, safer, and more structured Express apps — thanks to TypeScript

⎝^ _ ^⎠ Excited to keep going!
