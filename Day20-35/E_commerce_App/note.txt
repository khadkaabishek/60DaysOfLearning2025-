🌟 Day 35 of Learning 🌟
Today, I worked on enhancing the Admin Product Edit feature 🛠️ — now admins can update existing 
product details easily if they made any mistakes or want to make changes later. This makes the platform 
more flexible and reduces the chance of stale or incorrect information being shown to users. ⚙️

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Fetched existing product data using a secure `GET` request and pre-filled it into an editable form.
2. Allowed admins to update name, description, price, quantity, and category fields.
3. Integrated image file upload functionality using `multipart/form-data` and `multer` in the backend.
4. Used a `PUT` route (`/api/put_item/:id`) to send the updated form data and new images to the server.
5. Ensured successful image handling, validation, and proper updates in the database.

✅ Summary:

✔️ Enabled dynamic product editing for admin dashboard
✔️ Used `FormData` to support both text and image upload
✔️ Backend enhanced with `multer` and validation checks
✔️ Improved admin control over product accuracy and updates

Loving the progress! The admin panel now feels more **powerful and real-world ready** for product management 🚀🛍️
