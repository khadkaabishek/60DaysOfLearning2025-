🌟 Day 55 of Learning 🌟
Today, I implemented a functional search bar feature by enabling smooth 
communication between components — improving how users discover items quic-
kly and intuitively. 🔍⚡🧩

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Created a responsive SearchBar component to handle user input efficiently.
2. Lifted the search query state to the parent dashboard component for centraliz
   ed data control.
3. Filtered items in real-time and passed the updated list to the child display 
component.

 ✅ Summary:

✔️ Implemented inter-component data flow using **state lifting.
✔️ Designed a clean, intuitive search interface that fits seamlessly into the existing UI.
✔️ Made the item listing dynamic and responsive to user queries — enhancing the user experience.

Can’t wait to add filters(with regex) & sorting next — search is just the beginning! 🚀🛒
