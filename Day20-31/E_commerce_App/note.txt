🌟 Day 31 of Learning 🌟
Today, I worked on enhancing the frontend experience by implementing dynamic rendering for
 single product views and setting up navigation logic using React’s powerful routing tools ⚙️🎯

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Implemented logic to send the clicked product’s ID from card components.
2. Used `useNavigate` to route users to the single item detail page based on the selected product.
3. Handled data passing either through props or by fetching via the backend using the product ID.
4. Designed a clean and simple UI layout to display detailed product info – even looks cool with dummy data! 😄
5. Applied conditional rendering for admin and regular users:

   * Admins can see “Edit Content” buttons.
   * Users get “Buy Now” and “Add to Cart” options.

✅ Summary:

✔️ Created navigation logic to render a single item dynamically
✔️ Set up backend-response handling to fetch and display the product data
✔️ Built a user-role-specific UI using data from `localStorage`
✔️ Strengthened routing with `useParams` and `useNavigate`
✔️ Ensured admin/user role logic is clearly reflected in the UI

Super happy to see the components working together and the UI adapting based on user roles! 🙌🛒👨‍💼
