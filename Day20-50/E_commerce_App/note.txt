🌟 Day 50 of Learning 🌟
Today, I focused on building the backend functionality for placing 
orders, moving one step closer to a complete and functional check-
out flow. This part ensures that user purchases are securely stor-
ed and managed in the system. 🛠️📦🧾

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Sent order data to the backend using structured APIs triggered 
   from the frontend.
2. Created a robust Order Schema, referencing both the user and the
   product for accurate relational mapping.
3. Structured the routing using an MVC architecture, improving code 
   organization, scalability, and maintainability.

✅ Summary:

✔️ Connected frontend checkout to backend order handling via APIs.
✔️ Built a clean and relational database schema for storing order 
   details.
✔️ Improved backend architecture using MVC principles for clearer 
   flow and future flexibility.
