🌟 Day 44 of Learning 🌟
Today, I focused on building the backend logic for the Admin Panel — specifically
enabling seller application management by admins. This completes the backend fo-
undation needed to power the seller approval flow. 🧠💾🚦

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Linked each seller application with a specific user by adding `userID` as a 
reference from the User model — making it easier to track and separate applicants.
2. Built a controller to fetch all seller application requests for admin review.
3. Added a `PATCH` route to allow the admin to approve or reject seller 
requests from the frontend with a simple click.
4. Thoroughly tested all routes and controller logic using Postman, ensuring
 stable API functionality.

✅ Summary:
✔️ Connected applications to users using a reference field
✔️ Created API to fetch all pending/processed seller requests
✔️ Enabled status update (approve/reject) directly via PATCH endpoint
✔️ Verified backend logic and endpoints with Postman for smooth integration

With this, the backend logic for seller moderation is in place! Next up: connecting 
everything with the frontend for a seamless admin experience. 🚀📡🛍️
