🌟 Day 37 of Learning 🌟
Today, I focused on enhancing the seller experience and visibility on the platform 🛠️ 
— now sellers can view and manage only their own products, and product details include 
real seller identity for transparency and trust. 👤📦

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Implemented logic to allow sellers to edit a product only if they are the original uploader.
2. Created a dedicated page that displays products uploaded only by the logged-in seller.
3. Used Mongoose’s `.populate()` method to display the actual seller’s name and email 
   on product detail pages.
4. Fixed several backend and frontend bugs missed during earlier development phases.

✅ Summary:

✔️ Sellers can now only edit their own products — improving security and role-based control
✔️ Built a clean seller-only product listing page for focused management
✔️ Added clarity and trust by showing seller info (name & email) via `.populate()`
✔️ Resolved some silent bugs and issues for smoother performance 🛠️✨

Seller management features are becoming robust and seller-centric — excited to keep building! 💼🛒
Stay tuned for more UI enhancements and dashboard updates! 🎨🚀
