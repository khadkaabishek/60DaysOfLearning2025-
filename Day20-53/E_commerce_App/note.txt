🌟 Day 53 of Learning 🌟
Today, I focused on the seller-side functionality for reviewing
 and managing incoming orders. This marks an important milesto-
 ne toward giving sellers full control over their sales and bi-
 lling. 🧾📦🧑‍💻

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Created a dedicated Orders section for sellers, where they -
   can view all incoming orders placed by buyers.
2. Integrated a detailed Bill section, displaying full purchase 
   details including items, quantity, price, and buyer info he-
   lping sellers stay informed and organized.

✅ Summary:

✔️ Empowered sellers with a clear view of their incoming orders.
✔️ Built a comprehensive bill display for transaction-level cla-
   rity.
✔️ Laid the groundwork for seller-side delivery status and upda-
   tes (coming tomorrow!).
