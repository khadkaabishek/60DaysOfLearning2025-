TypeScript’s built-in utility types can significantly
reduce boilerplate and enhance type safety

Types : 
1. Partial<T> – Makes all properties optional
2. Required<T> – Forces all properties to be required
3. Readonly<T> – Makes properties immutable
4. Pick<T, K> – Selects specific keys from a type
5. Omit<T, K> – Excludes specific keys from a type
6. Record<K, T> – Constructs a type with keys K and values of type T
Truly, these utilities made working with complex types way more intuitive and clean!
