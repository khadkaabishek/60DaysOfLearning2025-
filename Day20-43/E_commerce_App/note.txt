🌟 Day 43 of Learning 🌟
Today, I focused on building the frontend for the Admin Panel, which becomes accessible 
only when an authenticated user with the `admin` role logs in. This marks the beginning of c
entralized control for managing users, sellers, and requests. 🛡️🧑‍💻📊

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Added role-based routing logic to ensure that only admins are routed to the admin dashboard 
   after login.
2. Implemented a loading component to verify user role before rendering admin views, adding an
    extra layer of UI safety.
3. Created structured pages for:

   * User Management**: View all registered customers.
   * Sellers Section**: Monitor onboarded sellers.
   * Requests Section**: Review and approve pending seller requests.

✅ Summary:
✔️ Setup conditional routing based on user role (admin only access)
✔️ Created essential views for users, sellers, and request monitoring
✔️ Established a scalable frontend structure for admin functionalities
✔️ Improved UX with loading logic to prevent flicker during verification

This admin dashboard sets the stage for a complete seller approval flow and efficient platform moderation.
 Coming up: backend logic for reviewing and approving/rejecting seller requests! 🚀📥🛒
