🌟 Day 26 of Learning 🌟

Today, I integrated a full frontend form to add products with image uploads,
 connecting it seamlessly to the backend API I built earlier 🚀

 🎯 What I worked on:

 Built a React form to capture product details and images
 Used `fetch` with `FormData` to send data securely to the backend
 Tested the full flow end-to-end — frontend sending data, backend processing, and storing in MongoDB
 Verified images upload correctly and product data is saved

 ✅ Summary:

✔️ Connected frontend product form with backend API
✔️ Implemented file upload handling on the client side
✔️ Tested and confirmed smooth full-stack integration

Feeling great about seeing everything working like a charm! 🎉
