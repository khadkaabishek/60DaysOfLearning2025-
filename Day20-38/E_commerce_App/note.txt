🌟 Day 38 of Learning 🌟
Today, I focused on building the backend functionality for user interactions 🛠️
— now users can engage with products more meaningfully through likes and comments,
 all while maintaining secure authentication. 💬❤️🔐

🎯 What I worked on:
1. Designed and created a Mongoose model for interactions with attributes like `isLiked`, `comment`, `user`, and `product`.
2. Built controllers for fetching and posting interactions — enabling real-time engagement from users.
3. Separated JWT token verification into its own reusable middleware function for clean and secure user authentication.
4. Used Postman to rigorously test all API routes and ensure accurate request/response cycles.

✅ Summary:
✔️ Structured interaction model to support likes and comments per product
✔️ Developed controller logic for smooth CRUD operations on interactions
✔️ Implemented robust token verification for secure and authenticated endpoints
✔️ Verified backend logic and stability using Postman tests 🔁🧪

The interaction system is now live and scalable — paving the way for richer user engagement! 🚀
Next up: syncing these features into the frontend for seamless user experience! 🌐✨
