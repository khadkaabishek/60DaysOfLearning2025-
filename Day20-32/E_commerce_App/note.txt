🌟 Day 32 of Learning 🌟
Today, I worked on enhancing the frontend experience of the cart management system by allowing users
 to select item quantities and add them to the cart (backend still in progress) 🛒⚙️

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Implemented quantity selector logic where users can only pick between **1** and the product’s `noOfQuantityAvailable`.
2. Designed and integrated an intuitive UI on the product detail page for choosing item quantity with `+` and `–` buttons.
3. Created an “Add to Cart” mechanism that sends the selected quantity along with the product details to the backend (to be implemented).
4. Displayed `noOfQuantityAvailable` clearly on the item display section to guide users and limit invalid purchases.
5. Maintained conditional rendering based on user role:

✅ Summary:

✔️ Built logic to enforce quantity range based on available stock
✔️ Enhanced UI to allow quantity selection with stock awareness
✔️ Ensured role-specific features are clearly accessible
✔️ Prepared frontend POST structure for cart management (awaiting backend)
✔️ Refined the product display to include stock availability hints

Loving the progress! The cart UI now feels more realistic and smarter for user interactions 🙌✨
