🌟 Day 34 of Learning 🌟
Today, I worked on manipulating the User Cart section 🛒 — now users can add, remove, or adjust
 item quantities, and dynamically view the total amount payable** based on their selections. While doing so
 , I revisited the powerful `.reduce()` method — a great reminder after a long time! 💡

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Enabled users to increase or decrease item quantity** directly from the cart interface.
2. Allowed users to remove individual items from the cart if they no longer wish to buy them.
3. Implemented real-time total price calculation based on quantity changes using the `.reduce()` method.
4. Enhanced the cart UI for better interactivity and clearer cost breakdowns.
5. Added conditional logic to prevent setting quantity below 1 or exceeding available stock.

✅ Summary:

✔️ Improved cart management with quantity manipulation and item removal
✔️ Used `.reduce()` effectively to calculate total payable amount
✔️ Made the cart UI more dynamic and responsive
✔️ Ensured better user control and feedback in the shopping process

Loving how it’s coming together! The cart now feels more interactive and useful for real-world scenarios 🚀🧾
