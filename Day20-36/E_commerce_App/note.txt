Today, I implemented a confirmation popup system for deleting products 🗑️ — now users must
 explicitly confirm before any item is removed. This adds a much-needed safety check and prevents
  accidental deletions, enhancing the overall UX and platform integrity. 🔒

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Added a modal popup that appears when the "Delete" button is clicked.
2. The popup asks for confirmation with two choices: Yes, Delete and Cancel.
3. If the user confirms, the item is deleted via a secure `DELETE` request.
4. Implemented logic to allow deletion only if the product was uploaded by the logged-in seller.
5. Secured the backend route to verify product ownership using JWT token authorization.

✅ Summary:

✔️ Integrated confirmation modal for critical delete action
✔️ Restricted delete access to only the original owner/seller
✔️ Backend now cross-checks the token user ID with the product's `owner` field
✔️ Improved trust and safety in the seller experience 👨‍💼

The seller dashboard is shaping up well — with strong control over their own products and intuitive UX! 🛍️🧠
