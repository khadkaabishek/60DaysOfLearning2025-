🌟 Day 51 of Learning 🌟
Today, I continued working on the backend logic for placing orders,
 focusing on pushing real-time data from the buyer and keeping both
  sellers and buyers in the loop. Things are shaping up well behind
   the scenes! 🔄🛍️📬

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Implemented logic to push items from the buyer’s cart into the O-
   rders collection.
2. Used nested `.populate()` methods to fetch detailed cart item in-
   fo, including products and user data.
3. Retrieved both buyer details and corresponding seller information
   to attach to each order.
4. Sent notifications to sellers when new orders are placed — helping
   keep them updated in real-time.

✅ Summary:

✔️ Enabled full cart-to-order transition by linking user and product 
   data.
✔️ Fetched nested relational data with advanced populate techniques.
✔️ Connected sellers to real-time order notifications for improved wo-
   rkflow.

Excited to continue this — next up: displaying all placed orders on the UI! 🚀📦
