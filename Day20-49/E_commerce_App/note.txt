🌟 Day 49 of Learning 🌟
Today, I focused on building out the Checkout UI to ensure users 
have a clear and smooth experience while placing their orders. This-
stage is crucial — it captures user details and confirms the final 
bill before payment. 🧾📦✨

🎯 What I worked on:

1.Designed a clean, two-part Checkout UI — one side for the input
  form, the other for billing clarity.
2.Created an input form for users to enter their contact details
  like name, phone, and address.
3.Added a Bill Summary section to clearly show the total cost, in-
  cluding product price and shipping.

✅ Summary:

✔️ Built a dual-pane Checkout layout: contact form + bill breakdown.
✔️ Integrated contact detail collection into the order flow.
✔️ Made sure users can review charges before confirming their order.
