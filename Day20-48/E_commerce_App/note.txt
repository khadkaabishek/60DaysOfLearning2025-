🌟 Day 48 of Learning 🌟
Today, I focused on building a smooth and intuitive Cart UI to
prepare users for the payment process. A clear cart experience 
setsthe tone for confident checkout — and I’m hyped for what’s
coming next! 🛒💳🔥

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Designed a clean and functional Cart UI, split into two sections
 for better clarity — one for items and one for billing.
2. Added a Bill Summary section that clearly shows the total cost a
 user has to pay.
3. Introduced a default shipping fee of ₹100, which gets added auto-
matically to every order (for now — dynamic shipping coming soon 👀).

✅ Summary:

✔️ Built the Cart screen with a dual-pane layout: items + billing.
✔️ Integrated a clear cost breakdown including product price + shipping.
✔️ Applied a default ₹100 shipping fee to prep the billing logic for fut-
ure enhancements.

Excited to connect this with the payment flow next! Let’s gooo 🚀💡
