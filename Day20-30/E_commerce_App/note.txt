🌟 Day 30 of Learning 🌟
Today, I worked on enhancing the frontend of my e-commerce platform using React by implementing
 a dynamic product card system with role-based UI rendering 🚀

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Designed a reusable React component to display product information in a card layout.
2. Loaded product images dynamically from the backend server using conditional rendering.
3. Used `localStorage` to fetch and parse the logged-in user’s data and role.
4. Displayed different button options based on user role:

   * Admins see “Edit Info”
   * Normal users see “Buy Now”
5. Built a responsive header with conditional navigation links and user avatar display.


✅ Summary:

✔️ Created a clean UI for displaying product cards
✔️ Enabled role-based button actions using user role stored in `localStorage`
✔️ Improved UX with dynamic header controls and navigation
✔️ Strengthened frontend logic by separating admin and user interactions

Feeling great to see the frontend behaving differently for admins and customers! 🎨🛍👥
