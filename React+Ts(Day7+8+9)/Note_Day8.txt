🌟 Day 8 of Learning 🌟
Today, I focused on one of the most commonly used concepts in React — the `useState` hook,
 this time with TypeScript! Despite exams, I made sure to grasp this foundational piece clearly.

---

🎯 What I learned today:

1. **Dived deep into `useState` with TypeScript**
   I understood how the `useState` hook works under the hood, and why we must initialize it properly,
    especially when using TypeScript for type safety.

2. **Explored implicit vs. explicit type casting**
   I learned the differences between implicit and explicit casting and why being intentional with types 
   is important in a strongly typed environment like TypeScript.

3. **Hands-on comparison: Explicit > Implicit**
   Through hands-on examples, I proved to myself that explicit casting provides more clarity, reduces 
   bugs, and makes the code more maintainable.

📌 Summary:
✔ Understood and implemented the `useState` hook with TypeScript
✔ Learned how to properly initialize state with and without type annotations
✔ Discovered the importance of type casting — especially why explicit casting leads to cleaner, safer code
✔ Even with exams, I made meaningful progress on concepts that will definitely help long-term

⎝^ _ ^⎠ Small day, big learnings — and grateful for every bit of it! More to come soon 🚀
