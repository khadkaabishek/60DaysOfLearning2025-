🌟 Day 27 of Learning 🌟
Today, I implemented essential backend routes to manage product data using Express 
and MongoDB — enabling full CRUD control 🚀

🎯 What I worked on:
1.Built a GET /get_item route to fetch all products from the database

2.Created a PATCH /patch_item route to update specific fields of a product

3.Implemented PUT /put_item to fully replace product info

4.Added DELETE /delete_item to remove products from the database

✅ Summary:

✔️ Developed multiple RESTful API endpoints for product management
✔️ Handled invalid ObjectId errors gracefully with validation
✔️ Tested all routes using Postman to ensure correct functionality

Feeling confident as the backend foundation is getting stronger day by day! 🔧🔥
