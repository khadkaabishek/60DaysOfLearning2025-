🌟 Day 52 of Learning 🌟
Today, I continued working on both the frontend and backend of 
the order placement flow, making meaningful progress to ensure 
a smoother user experience and better data handling. Orders are
now visible to buyers — we’re getting closer to a full transa-
ction cycle! 🛒💻✅

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Made slight adjustments to the Order Schema — took a snapshot
 of the cart at order time to preserve order state and allow safe
  cart deletion post-checkout.
2. Created a dedicated "My Orders" page where buyers can view all
 their previously placed orders, complete with key details and c-
 larity.

✅ Summary:

✔️ Improved order data consistency with a snapshot approach for bet-
ter UX.
✔️ Enabled buyers to view their full order history via the new "My -
Orders" screen.
✔️ Set the stage for seller-side order management (coming next!).

Excited to continue — sellers will start managing their orders tomor-
