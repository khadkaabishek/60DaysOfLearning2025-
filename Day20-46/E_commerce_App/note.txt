🌟 Day 46 of Learning 🌟
Today, I focused on implementing a notification feature in my platform
 — ensuring that users receive real-time updates about important actions 
 like seller approval or rejection. This adds an interactive layer to the 
 user experience. 🔔📩✅

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Created a clean notification icon with a dropdown UI, allowing users
 to view their latest notifications easily.
2. Designed and implemented a Notification Schema in the database to store 
user-specific notification data.
3. Wrote conditional messages (e.g., when an admin approves a seller 
  request → success message; else → rejection message).
4. Sent proper API responses to the frontend and successfully fetched and 
displayed notifications without using Postman — proving the logic is solid and 
my concepts are getting stronger.

✅ Summary:
✔️ Built a functional notification UI with dropdown
✔️ Created a robust backend schema for storing notifications
✔️ Implemented dynamic, condition-based notification messages
✔️ Integrated API response fetching seamlessly on the frontend

Next step: Add real-time notifications with WebSockets or Pusher for an even 
smoother user experience! 🚀🔗
