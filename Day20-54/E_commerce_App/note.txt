🌟 Day 54 of Learning 🌟
Today, I focused on implementing delivery status management from both the
seller and buyer perspectives — making the order lifecycle more transpa-
rent, trackable, and user-friendly. 📦✅🔔

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Added a "Dispatched" button on the seller side to update the delivery-
   status once an item is on the way.
2. Enabled sellers to mark an order as “Delivered”, which automatically -
   triggers a notification to the buyer.
3. Allowed the buyer to verify the delivery at the end — especially impo-
   rtant for Cash on Delivery orders.

✅ Summary:

✔️ Built a full delivery status flow from seller dispatch to buyer confi-
   rmation.
✔️ Synced delivery actions with real-time notifications.
✔️ Laid the foundation for post-delivery feedback or return features.
