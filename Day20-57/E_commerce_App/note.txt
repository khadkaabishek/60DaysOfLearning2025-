🌟 Day 57 of Learning 🌟
Today, I explored OAuth 2.0, a widely used method for seamless authentication 
and authorization — the tech behind those familiar "Login with Google/Facebook"
buttons we see every day. 🔐🌐✨

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Understood the OAuth 2.0 flow — including how authorization codes are generated,
   verified, and saved to the project server.
2. Set up my first Google OAuth Client ID via the Google Cloud Console.
3. Rendered a basic Google sign-in button and successfully triggered the account 
   selection UI.
4. Encountered a COOP-related error — but noted it as a minor issue for later 
   resolution.

✅ Summary:

✔️ Gained a solid foundation on how modern third-party login systems work.
✔️ Took the first hands-on steps toward integrating Google sign-in in a MERN project.
✔️ Boosted confidence to implement full OAuth login flows soon.

Next up: Debug the COOP error and connect the OAuth data to backend storage! 🚀🔧🧠
