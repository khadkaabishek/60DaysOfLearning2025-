🌟 Day 47 of Learning 🌟
Today, I focused on tightening up the user–seller communication flow in my platform 
— making sure the right email shows up in the right place, and that users get timely
 confirmation emails when they sign up or log in. These changes reduce confusion and 
 build trust in the system. ✉️✅💡
 🎯 What I worked on:

1. Replaced user email with the seller’s official email in relevant views and API 
responses to avoid identity confusion — especially important when admins or buyers
 interact with multiple sellers.
2. Implemented automated emails after successful signup and login, so users receive
 confirmation and a friendly “you’re in!” message. (Helps with onboarding, trust,
  and troubleshooting login issues.)
3. Improved the UI for better UX**, polishing layout spacing, labels, and message 
clarity where emails appear. Reduced visual noise and made status/ownership clearer.


✅ Summary:

✔️ Eliminated email mix-ups by showing the correct seller email in UI & data flows.
✔️ Added post-signup and post-login email confirmations.
✔️ Polished UI elements to make ownership and actions clearer to users.
