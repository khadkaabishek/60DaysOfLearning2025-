Day2 Of Learning,
Today, I explored two powerful features in TypeScript: Mapped Types and Conditional Types.

Mapped types:
Mapped types allow you to create new types by transforming properties of an existing type.

Syntax  ...
type NewType = {
    [K in keyof OldType]: ModifiedType
  };

Use Examples : 
1. Making All Properties Optional
2. Converting All Property Types
3. Readonly Properties
4. Wrapping Properties in Promises
5. Removing Nullable Fields
6. Boolean Flags for Each Field
etc.


Conditional types
Conditional types let you choose types based on conditions.

Syntax  ... 
T extends U ? X : Y;

Use Examples : 
1.Type Checks
2. Filtering Union Types
3. Checking for Arrays
4. Inferring Return Types
