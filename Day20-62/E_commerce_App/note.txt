🌟 Day 62 of Learning 🌟
 Today was all about seller-side analytics — turning raw order data into visual insights! 
 📊📩 I worked on crafting a clean, functional analytics page to track daily sales growth 
 and patterns. It was a rewarding mix of backend data fetching and frontend charting.

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Used advanced `populate` techniques in Mongoose to extract nested product-owner info 
   for daily sale analysis.
2. Integrated `recharts` to visualize sales trends — bar charts for daily performance!
3. Utilized `date-fns` to process and format dates for precise day-by-day filtering.
4. Cleaned up the codebase by introducing reusable service functions to avoid duplication 
   and keep things DRY.

✅ Summary:

✔️ Sellers can now see how their products are performing with visual daily breakdowns.
✔️ Backend API is optimized for analytical data — filtered and formatted cleanly.
✔️ Charts render dynamically based on selected dates, improving UX significantly.
✔️ Code is modular, cleaner, and much easier to scale from here on out.

Learning how to communicate data visually is 🔑 — and I’m loving every bit of it.
